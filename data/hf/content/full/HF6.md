Can a large language model (LLM) improve at code generation using only its own raw outputs, without a verifier, a teacher model, or reinforcement learning�We answer in the affirmative with simple self-distillation (SSD): sample solutions from the model with certain temperature and truncation configurations, then fine-tune on those samples with standard supervised fine-tuning. SSD improves Qwen3-30B-Instruct from 42.4% to 55.3% pass@1 on LiveCodeBench v6, with gains concentrating on harder problems, and it generalizes across Qwen, Llama, and GPT-OSS models at 4B–30B scale, including both instruct and thinking variants. To understand why such a simple method can work, we trace these gains to a _precision-exploration conflict_ in LLM decoding and show that SSD reshapes token distributions in a context-dependent way, suppressing distractor tails where precision matters while preserving useful diversity where exploration matters. Taken together, SSD offers a complementary post-training direction for improving LLM code generation.

**Figure 1 Simple self-distillation (SSD) is embarrassingly simple, yet yields substantial LiveCodeBench v6 gains across six models spanning three families and multiple scales, with both instruct and thinking variants.** Left: SSD samples from the base model with training-time decoding temperature _T_ train, fine-tunes on its own raw outputs, and then decodes at evaluation time with _T_ eval; it uses no RL,verifier,teacher,or code execution environment. Right: LiveCodeBench v6 pass@1 for Qwen3-4B-Instruct and Qwen3-30B-Instruct on the Overall, Medium, and Hard splits (orange = 4B, blue = 30B; hatched = base, solid = +SSD). The footer highlights the broader pattern: all six evaluated models improve, Qwen3-30B-Instruct gains +30% relative pass@1, and the largest gains occur on harder problems.

## **1 Introduction** 

As LLMs are deployed to increasingly difficult coding tasks, the supply of high-quality supervised signal has become a binding constraint: human-written solutions (Chen et al., 2021; Austin et al., 2021; Hendrycks et al., 2021a) are expensive to produce, and synthetic data pipelines require either a stronger teacher model (Hinton et al., 2015; Kim and Rush, 2016; Hsieh et al., 2023; Agarwal et al., 2024) or execution-based verification for every training problem (Li et al., 2022; Le et al., 2022; Singh et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2025). Teacher-based distillation also inherits the ceiling of the teacher, while reinforcement learning with verifiable reward remains operationally complex and can be unstable, even in recent RL-based reasoning and coding pipelines (He et al., 2026; Shao et al., 2024; DeepSeek-AI, 2025; OpenAI, 2025). Unsupervised alternatives that use intrinsic rewards such as majority voting or entropy minimization (Zuo et al., 2025; Agarwal et al., 2025) have shown early promise but face reward hacking and collapse under extended training (Zhang et al., 2025). This raises a natural question: can a model improve itself without leveraging any external labeled data or verification at all� 

We show the answer is yes. Our method, _simple self-distillation_ (SSD), is embarrassingly simple: sample solutions from the base model with specified temperature and truncation, then fine-tune on those raw, unverified samples via standard cross-entropy loss. This method requires only a set of problem prompts and the model itself: no humanlabeled solutions, no reference answers, no teacher model, no reward model, no verifier, no execution environment, and no reinforcement learning of any kind. 

Surprisingly, it works. SSD improves Qwen3-30B-Instruct from 42.4% to 55.3% pass@1 on LiveCodeBench v6 (Jain et al., 2024), with especially large gains on hard problems. Coverage improvements are larger still: hard-problem pass@5 rises from 31.1% to 54.1%, suggesting that SSD preserves useful exploration across solution branches instead of only sharpening a single dominant mode. These gains are not model-specific: SSD generalizes across six models spanning three families, multiple scales, and both instruct and thinking models. 

We study why such a simple method can work in the domain of code generation, which serves as a particularly useful testbed because the task structure makes the underlying mechanism especially visible. Code interleaves _fork_ positions, where several continuations are genuinely plausible and may correspond to different solution approaches, with _lock_ positions, where syntax and semantics leave little ambiguity but a low-probability distractor tail still remains. These two context types make contradictory demands on decoding temperature _T_ eval. Lowering _T_ eval secures locks but starves forks of diversity, while raising it enables exploration at forks but lets distractors flood back in at locks. The best global decoding setting is therefore necessarily a compromise; we call this tension the _precision-exploration conflict_ . 

SSD can be understood through this lens. Training on temperature-shifted, truncated samples implicitly reshapes the model’s distributions in a context dependent way (we formalize this later as _support compression_ and _within support reshaping_ in Equation (4)): it suppresses distractors most aggressively at locks while preserving useful diversity at forks. Evidence from controlled simulation and real-model analysis (Section 4.2), together with theoretical analysis (Section B), supports this account and explains why changing only the decoding settings cannot recover the gains. More broadly, this suggests that existing code models contain capability not realized under fixed decoding alone. 

Our contributions are threefold. First, we show that SSD can substantially improve code generation models’ per- 

2 

formance using only their own unverified outputs, without any external teacher, verifier, reward model, or labeled solutions. Second, we identify the _precision-exploration conflict_ and argue that it is the key mechanism behind SSD. Third, we support this mechanism with aligned evidence from controlled simulation, real-model analysis, and theory. 

## **2 Embarrassingly Simple Self-Distillation (SSD)** 

**Data synthesis.** We write _T_ for the temperature and _ρ_ for the truncation configuration, namely the top- _k_ and top- _p_ used in decoding (see Section A for the precise decoding procedure). Given a _frozen_ pre-trained LLM _pθ_ and a set of prompts _X_ , we sample _N_ candidate solutions per problem: 



The solutions are not verified in any way: no execution,no test cases,no filtering by correctness. The raw outputs form the simple self-distillation dataset _D_ SSD. In practice, _N_ =1 (a single sample per prompt) already suffices (Section 3). 

**Training.** We fine-tune the model on _D_ SSD with standard supervised fine-tuning (SFT): 



**Inference.** The fine-tuned model _pθ_<sup>_∗_</sup> is deployed with evaluation-time decoding configuration ( _T_ eval _, ρ_ eval): 



## **3 Experiments** 

### **3.1 Experimental Setup** 

**Models.** We evaluate SSD on six models spanning three families (Llama,Qwen,GPT-OSS),scales from 4B to 30B,and two reasoning styles (instruct, thinking): Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct (dense, 8B), Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507 (dense, 4B; hereafter _Qwen3-4B-Instruct_ ),Qwen3-4B-Thinking-2507 (dense,4B; hereafter _Qwen3-4B-Thinking_ ),Qwen3-30BA3B-Instruct-2507 (MoE, 30B total / 3B active; hereafter _Qwen3-30B-Instruct_ ), Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507 (MoE, 30B / 3B active; hereafter _Qwen3-30B-Thinking_ ), and GPT-OSS-20B (MoE, 21B total / 3.6B active; hereafter _GPT-OSS-20B_ ). We apply SSD to each of these _base_ models. 

**Data synthesis.** We use the seed subset of the rSTARcoder dataset (Liu et al., 2025), de-duplicated to yield _∼_ 10K unique competitive programming problems. For each prompt we sample a single solution from the base model using the per-model generation decoding configuration in Table 3. We apply only minimal syntactic filtering to remove empty responses and single line stubs, meaning there is absolutely **no correctness signal** used. Generation uses vLLM (Kwon et al., 2023) with 128K maximum sequence length limit. 

**Training.** We fine-tune with Megatron-LM<sup>1</sup> on 8 _×_ B200 GPUs (EP=8 for MoE models), using AdamW with cosine decay (peak LR 5 _×_ 10<sup>_−_6</sup> ), global batch size 32, sequence length 65,536, and 2,500 iterations for instruct models and 300 iterations for thinking models. The learning rate is warmed-up with 250 and 50 iterations, respectively. 

**Evaluation.** Our primary benchmark is LiveCodeBench v6 (LCB v6; Feb–May 2025, following the version split adopted by recent model releases<sup>2</sup> ; stratified by easy/medium/hard). We report LCB v5 (Aug 2024–Feb 2025, following the version split adopted by rSTARcoder (Liu et al., 2025)) as a secondary confirmation. The primary metric is pass@1; we also report pass@5 and per-difficulty breakdowns. Base-model results use each model’s officially recommended sampling parameters (Table 4); SSD models are evaluated with the decoding settings in Table 3. Full experimental details, prompt formatting, and decoding settings are given in Section C.1.

### **3.2 SSD Improves Code Generation Across the Board** 

**SSD yields large gains on LiveCodeBench.** On LCB v6, SSD improves Qwen3-30B-Instruct from 42.4% to 55.3% pass@1 (+12.9pp,+30.4% relative). The gains are broad across the evaluated models: Llama-8B improves by +3.5pp, Qwen3-4B-Instruct by +7.5pp,Qwen3-4B-Thinking by +3.3pp,Qwen3-30B-Thinking by +2.1pp,and GPT-OSS-20B by +5.3pp. Substantial gains also appear on the larger 374-problem LCB v5, where Qwen3-30B-Instruct improves from 45.8% to 54.3% pass@1 (+8.5pp). For a recipe based only on self-generated, unverified solutions and standard supervised fine-tuning, these are consistently strong improvements. 

**SSD helps most on harder problems.** For Qwen3-30B-Instruct on LCB v6, pass@1 improves by +6.5pp on easy problems,+14.2pp on medium problems,and +15.3pp on hard problems. The same concentration appears at pass@5, where the gains are +6.6pp on easy, +19.6pp on medium, and +23.0pp on hard. A similar pattern is visible in the Qwen thinking models: for Qwen3-4B-Thinking, hard pass@1 improves by +4.1pp versus +1.3pp on easy problems, and for Qwen3-30B-Thinking, the corresponding gains are +5.2pp versus +0.2pp. Across Table 2, the medium and hard splits consistently account for the largest absolute gains. 

**SSD does not collapse diversity.** A second clear pattern in the table is that the gains are often larger at pass@5 than at pass@1,indicating that SSD preserves and even improves generation diversity. Across the Qwen models on LCB v6, the pass@5 gain exceeds the corresponding pass@1 gain: +15.8pp versus +7.5pp for Qwen3-4B-Instruct, +3.9pp versus +3.3pp for Qwen3-4B-Thinking,+18.1pp versus +12.9pp for Qwen3-30B-Instruct,and +3.5pp versus +2.1pp for Qwen3-30B-Thinking. For Qwen3-30B-Instruct, the same asymmetry is even larger on the hard subset, where pass@5 rises by +23.0pp while pass@1 rises by +15.3pp; on LCB v5, pass@5 likewise improves more than pass@1 (+12.0pp versus +8.5pp). These larger pass@5 gains are consistent with improved diversity across generation samples. 

Because SSD is trained only on competitive-programming data, a natural concern is that it may hurt performance

**Figure 2 SSD outperforms the best point in the evaluated base-model decoding sweep within standard global decoding policies.** Each panel shows one model (30B-Instruct, 4B-Instruct, 4B-Thinking) and one metric (pass@1 or pass@5); amber curves sweep base-model evaluation temperature while blue horizontal lines mark SSD results from Table 2. Solid shading marks the margin over all problems; outlined (dashed-border) shading marks the margin on hard problems. 

outside that domain. To test this,we evaluate the same trained model out of the box on benchmarks for math reasoning, general code generation,and code understanding,without any additional training or adaptation. Performance remains broadly stable for the 30B models, see Section C.3. 

### **3.3 Global Decoding Policies Cannot Match SSD** 

Could the gains in Table 2 be recovered _without_ training,by tuning only evaluation-time decoding on the original base model�We test this within the standard family of global temperature and truncation ( _T_ eval _, ρ_ eval) decoding policies, sweeping evaluation-time decoding settings on the base model and comparing the best evaluated base-model configuration to SSD. For this comparison, we follow the officially recommended sampling settings for each model (see Table 4) and sweep temperature extensively to probe the strongest decode-only performance achievable by the base model. Figure 2 visualizes representative temperature sweeps and the remaining gap to SSD. 

**Temperature tuning yields only modest gains on the base model.** The base-model sweep curves are strikingly flat: for Qwen3-30B-Instruct, pass@1 ranges from 41.3% to 43.5% across the evaluated temperatures, a spread of only 2.2 pp. The other models show similarly narrow ranges (1.5–3.0 pp; Figure 2). 

**SSD still outperforms the best-tuned base model, especially on hard problems and at pass@5.** Comparing SSD against the best-tuned base model, pass@1 advantages remain: +11.8 pp for Qwen3-30B-Instruct, +5.8 pp for Qwen3-4B-Instruct, +2.2 pp for Qwen3-4B-Thinking, and +1.1 pp for Qwen3-30B-Thinking. The gap widens on hard problems: for Qwen3-30B-Instruct, SSD exceeds the best-tuned base model by +13.3 pp on hard pass@1 and +19.4 pp on hard pass@5, both larger than the corresponding all-problem margins. This pattern holds across all models,the SSD advantage is consistently largest on hard problems at pass@5. These persistent margins indicate that SSD produces changes in the model itself in ways no decoding configuration can replicate, an effect we investigate in Section 4.

### **3.4 How SSD Hyperparameters Interact** 

To understand the best configuration of training and inference hyperparameters for SSD, we performed a grid search over _T_ train, and evaluated each checkpoint at multiple _T_ eval, with Qwen3-30B-Instruct on LCB v6. We compare two regimes: a no-truncation ablation, where temperature composition is cleanest, and the full truncated setting, where training-time truncation provides an additional gain channel. Full details are in Section C.2. 

**Without truncation, effective temperature organizes performance.** _T_ train and _T_ eval trade off each other: _T_ train controls how strongly SSD reshapes the model distribution, while _T_ eval controls how aggressively decoding exploits that reshaped distribution. Define _T_ eff = _T_ train _· T_ eval; we show that _T_ eff governs performance. To isolate this, we run a search with only temperature scaling ( _T_ train _∈{_ 0 _._ 5 _,_ 0 _._ 7 _,_ 1 _._ 0 _,_ 1 _._ 5 _,_ 2 _._ 0 _}_ and _T_ eval _∈_ [0 _._ 6 _,_ 1 _._ 5]; Figure 3a,Figure 10), and no truncation _ρ_ train. In this regime, the two temperatures compose cleanly: configurations are well governed by _T_ eff, with _R_<sup>2</sup> =0 _._ 75 and a quadratic peak near _T_ eff _≈_ 1 _._ 2, as formalized in Section B.3. This also explains why higher _T_ train makes the model more responsive to _T_ eval: stronger training-time reshaping creates more room for evaluation-time decoding to trade off precision against diversity. Intuitively, higher _T_ eff is preferred to have more diverse generation as long as the generation is not broken. 

**With truncation, the performance ceiling rises.** When a nontrivial training-time truncation configuration _ρ_ train is used during SSD data generation, the truncated runs (amber/green in Figure 3a) remain above the baseline across a wider range of _T_ eff than the no-truncation runs (gray), though the exact collapse onto _T_ eff no longer holds. This is expected: training-time truncation adds a second improvement channel on top of temperature composition by suppressing lowprobability tails during data synthesis. Among the truncated runs,the best observed setting uses _T_ train=2 _._ 0, _T_ eval=1 _._ 1, and training-time top- _k_ =10, reaching 49.7% pass@1 (+7.3 pp), above all no-truncation results. As expected, the optimal _T_ eff generally shifts towards a higher temperature with more stringent truncation. Similarly, the diagonal-band pattern appears for Qwen3-4B-Thinking (Figure 3b,Figure 11),confirming that the temperature-composition structure extends to thinking models. 

## **4 Why SSD Works** 

The gains above raise a natural question: what changes inside the model during simple self-distillation, and why can’t the same effect be achieved by simply adjusting how the original model decodes�Our hypothesis is that the answer lies in a structural conflict in generation. Some tokens demand precision, others demand exploration, and any fixed decoding configuration must compromise between them. SSD helps by reshaping token distributions in a way that alleviates this conflict. We validate this mechanism in three steps: a controlled toy simulation, real model analysis, and

**Figure 4 A single evaluation temperature cannot satisfy both exploration at forks and precision at locks. Left:** a sorting example in which the algorithm-choice token is a _fork_ position (rust-orange), while the later uses of `mid` are _lock_ positions (blue); gray ghost branches indicate other valid algorithms that could have been taken at the fork. **Right:** token distributions for the same two context types under low and high _T_ eval,with head and tail mass shown explicitly. Low _T_ eval keeps the lock precise but collapses the fork’s viable head ( _low exploration_ ); high _T_ eval restores exploration at the fork but revives the lock’s distractor tail ( _low precision_ ). 

theoretical decomposition. 

### **4.1 The Precision-Exploration Conflict Hypothesis** 

We will take code generation as an example. At certain positions, syntax and context leave almost no ambiguity: after `if n ==` , the model must produce a specific value, and it knows which one, yet a long tail of syntactically plausible alternatives still carries nontrivial probability mass. At other positions, the distribution is genuinely spread across multiple viable continuations: when beginning the body of a function, the model might open with a `for` loop, a recursive call,or a data-structure initialization,each leading to a fundamentally different solution. We hypothesize that these two kinds of positions make fundamentally contradictory demands on the decoding configuration (Figure 4). 

We call the first a **lock** : a position where the distribution is sharply peaked, with very few tokens carrying most of the mass and a long distractor tail carrying the rest. We call the second a **fork** (Bigelow et al., 2025; Wang et al., 2025b): a position where the distribution is spread across multiple plausible tokens that can lead to meaningfully different downstream continuations. Locks demand precision: commit to the dominant token and suppress the tail. Forks demand exploration: spread mass across viable alternatives to avoid missing the good paths. 

Under this view, inference temperature _T_ eval is what makes the conflict irreconcilable. Scaling by _T_ eval flattens or sharpens the entire distribution _pT_ ( _v_ ) _∝ p_ ( _v_ )<sup>1</sup><sup>_/T_</sup> : higher _T_ eval compresses probability gaps, pulling tokens toward equal footing; lower _T_ eval widens them, amplifying the dominant peak. There is a dilemma. Lowering temperature sharpens the peak at a lock, suppressing distractors, but starves a fork of the diversity it needs. Raising temperature diversifies the head at a fork, giving lower-ranked correct continuations a chance, but destabilizes locks as the distractor tail regains mass. The best global setting, applied to every context in the sequence, is therefore necessarily a compromise: the temperature that helps forks is precisely what lets distractors resurface at locks. 

If this picture is right, then SSD should not sharpen the model uniformly: it should suppress distractor tails at locks while leaving more useful room for exploration at forks.

**Figure 5 SSD turns forks into plateaus and locks into spikes.** Tokens are ranked by probability. Hatched bars and dashed curves show the base model; solid bars and solid curves show the model after SSD; the red dashed cutoff marks the support retained during SSD. **(a)** Fork-like state: the diffuse tail is trimmed, but several top continuations remain and become more evenly weighted, forming a broad plateau over viable branches. **(b)** Lock-like state: the same rule trims the tail much more aggressively and concentrates mass on the dominant token, producing a sharper spike. 

### **4.2 How SSD Reshapes a Model: Toy Simulation and Real-Model Analysis** 

We now test that prediction in two settings. We begin with a toy environment where the conflict is explicit and success can be computed exactly. We then ask whether the same qualitative pattern appears in a real model. 

**Controlled simulation.** We begin with a minimal environment that contains exactly the structure in our hypothesis. Successful trajectories must pass through one fork state and then three lock states before reaching PASS; any wrong decision leads to FAIL. At the fork, several continuations are genuinely plausible. At each lock, one token is correct but a distractor tail remains. Because every transition is specified explicitly, the probability of success can be computed in closed form for any decoding temperature (full details are given in Section C.4). 

Even in this minimal setting, the same dilemma appears. Sweeping a single global decoding temperature on the base model recovers the same tradeoff as in Section 4.1: colder decoding protects the locks but starves the fork, while hotter decoding helps the fork but breaks the locks (Figure 14). The base model therefore operates at a narrow compromise. 

In the toy, SSD changes that compromise by reshaping the two regimes differently (Figure 5). At lock-like states, the low-probability tail is stripped away, so the dominant token becomes much harder to dislodge. At fork-like states, several plausible continuations remain near the top, but the useless tail is reduced and the surviving options become more even. These local changes widen the viable decoding regime itself: after SSD, the best decoding temperature shifts much higher, and success probability rises substantially. 

**The synergy between training and decoding.** The toy also shows why training and decoding are complementary rather than interchangeable. Training does not solve the fork by itself; it makes the locks less fragile. Decode-only temperature tuning does not clean up the locks by itself; it spends precision before it gains enough exploration at the fork. The improvement comes only when both stages act together. Training changes the distribution so the locks are safer; decoding then uses that extra room to explore the fork. 

**Real-model evidence.** We now look for the same pattern from the base Qwen3-30B-Instruct model and its SSD counterpart on LCB v6. The same two signatures appear. Relative to the base model, SSD reaches decoding with a cleaner head and a weaker distractor tail. 

Figure 6a shows the first effect directly. When tokens are ordered by probability, cumulative mass rises more quickly for SSD through the top ranks. Less probability is left behind in diffuse distractor tails before decoding even begins. This is the real-model analogue of the lock side of the toy.

**Figure 6 Real-model evidence that SSD both compresses distractor tails and makes** _T_ **eval more effective near the head.** Amber: base Qwen3-30B-Instruct; blue: after SSD. **(a)** When tokens are sorted by model probability, cumulative mass rises faster for SSD, indicating a cleaner head and weaker diffuse tail. **(b)** As _T_ eval increases, more tokens survive truncation in SSD than in the base model. **(c)** The entropy of the distribution after truncation increases much more strongly for SSD. **(d)** This higher entropy after truncation persists even when the two models place similar probability mass in their top 20 tokens, providing more viable alternatives for evaluation time exploration. Together, the base model enters decoding with more tail mass, while SSD offers more usable room for temperature to diversify the top of the distribution. 

Figure 6b–d show the second effect. Under the same evaluation-time decoding temperature and truncation ( _T_ eval _, ρ_ eval), raising _T_ eval changes the base model much less: the surviving set stays close to a singleton, so temperature has limited leverage. SSD behaves differently. As temperature rises, several top continuations remain viable, and the probabilities among those surviving options spread out much more strongly. This advantage persists even when the two models place similar probability mass in their top 20 tokens. The real-model evidence therefore matches the toy: SSD removes distractor mass where commitment matters and enlarges the region in which temperature can be used for exploration. 

The toy isolates the mechanism, and the real-model analysis shows the same mechanism in practice. SSD does not remove the conflict by making every context uniformly sharper. It relaxes the conflict asymmetrically: forks retain more usable alternatives near the top of the distribution, while locks become safer. That is why higher-temperature decoding becomes newly effective after training. The next subsection formalizes why these two changes can coexist: reduced tail mass where precision matters and more usable diversity near the top where exploration matters. 

### **4.3 A Theoretical View of SSD** 

We now turn to the theoretical view behind that picture. SSD fits the distribution induced by sampling the base model with _T_ train and _ρ_ train. That shift in the training signal leads to the objective decomposition below,explains why forks and locks respond differently, clarifies the entropy picture, and also explains why decode-only tuning cannot reproduce the same effect (Sections B.1 to B.5). 

**SSD induces support compression and within-support reshaping.** We begin with the distribution that SSD fits. During data synthesis, we sample from the base model under ( _T_ train _, ρ_ train). At any context, this procedure produces a retained set _S_ of tokens that survive temperature scaling and truncation, together with a renormalized distribution _q_ over that set. Let KeptMass _θ_ denote the probability mass that the model under optimization assigns to _S_ , and write _T ≡ T_ train. With this notation, the induced loss can be written as 



Here _H_ 1 _/T_ ( _π_ ) is the Rényi entropy of order 1 _/T_ , and _pθ,T_ ( _· | S_ ) is the model’s tempered distribution restricted to _S_ . The three terms have clear roles: the first term drives support compression, which removes diffuse tail mass to concentrate probability on a smaller set of viable tokens, the second reshapes the head within that set, and the third keeps that reshaping aligned with the base model on that same set (Sections B.1 and B.2). This decomposition is 

9 

central because it shows simple self distillation is not mere imitation; it enforces both _support compression_ and _head reshaping_ . 

**SSD sharpens locks while preserving forks.** Once written this way, the lock/fork asymmetry follows from what survives into the retained set at each type of context. At a lock, only one or a few tokens survive truncation, so support compression dominates: distractor mass is pushed out of the tail and the surviving head becomes relatively insensitive to _T_ eval. At a fork, several plausible continuations survive, so within-support reshaping has room to flatten and preserve the head without reopening the discarded tail. Appendix Section B.3 formalizes this asymmetry and shows how training-time and evaluation-time temperatures compose inside the retained set. 

**SSD lowers total entropy while preserving head exploration.** The fine-tuned model can become globally sharper while remaining more explorable at evaluation time because total entropy and useful exploration concern different objects. Appendix Section B.4 decomposes full-vocabulary entropy into a gate term, a head term, and a tail term: SSD lowers the gate and tail contributions by concentrating mass on the retained set, while the conditional head can remain broad enough at fork-like contexts for _T_ eval to diversify among viable continuations. 

**Understanding why decode-only tuning cannot match SSD.** Appendix Section B.5 shows that decode-only ( _T_ eval _, ρ_ eval) policies remain constrained by the base model’s existing ranking and cumulative curves: they can reweight a fixed distribution,but they cannot steepen locks and clean up fork heads in a context-dependent way. SSD changes the distribution itself, which is why the empirical decode-only gap in Section 3.3 persists. 

### **4.4 A Surprising Case: Bad Data, Good Results** 

We now push SSD into an intentionally pathological regime as a stress test for our established hypothesis and understanding, that SSD makes high-temperature _T_ eff possible and beneficial, as well as that training and decoding are complementary to each other in SSD. Starting from Qwen3-30B-Instruct, we raise the training temperature to _T_ train=2 _._ 0 and disable truncation entirely (setting _ρ_ train to be vacuous), asking whether SSD still helps when the sampled training outputs are overwhelmingly poor as programs. If the benefit of SSD depended primarily on training on good solutions, this setting should be close to a failure case. More details are in Section C.5. 

**In this stress test, the synthesized data is almost gibberish.** Without truncation to suppress the tail, sampling at _T_ train=2 _._ 0 produces outputs that are often unusable as code. About _∼_ 62% contain no extractable code at all, and even seemingly coherent solutions frequently devolve into multilingual gibberish mid-sequence (Figure 7a). By ordinary dataquality standards, this is unusable as training data for SFT. 

**SSD still improves the model materially.** Even when the synthesized outputs devolve into gibberish, the resulting fine-tuned model is not merely salvageable, it improves substantially. SSD improves the model to 48.1% pass@1 and 64.0% pass@5, for gains of +5.7 pp and +10.5 pp respectively (Figure 7b). This peak is not an isolated lucky cell: it sits inside a contiguous late-training ridge around _T_ eval _∈_ [0 _._ 8 _,_ 1 _._ 1], with several neighboring checkpoint and temperature pairs remaining within about 1 to 2 pp of the optimum (Figure 15b). As in earlier sections, the improvements are concentrated on hard problems: at the best setting, hard pass@1 increases by +7.3 pp and hard pass@5 by +13.8 pp. This demonstrates that _support compression_ and _distribution reshaping_ extract useful learning signals regarding token quality, meaning program correctness might not mainly drive the gains.

10 

**The gain depends on evaluation-time truncation.** Figure 15b shows a clear bounded operating region: within the viable low- _T_ eval band, the best results form a late-training ridge rather than a single spike, but performance still degrades sharply once _T_ eval becomes too high. That pattern is consistent with the idea that training alone is not enough here: without truncation during training, diffuse distractor tails remain and must be cleaned up at evaluation time by _ρ_ eval. This is also why the gains remain smaller than those of the headline truncated setting. Taken together, the case study suggests that SSD is not drawing its benefit mainly from training on correct code. Even in this pathological regime, the useful signal still comes from how high-temperature sampling reshapes token probabilities, while decoding-time truncation recovers enough precision to make that reshaping useful. 

## **5 Related Work** 

**Self-training and self-distillation.** Learning from model-generated targets has long been studied in self-training and distillation, including classical self-training, knowledge distillation, sequence-level distillation, and self-distillation (Amini et al., 2022; He et al., 2020; Hinton et al., 2015; Kim and Rush, 2016; Furlanello et al., 2018). In language modeling, recent work extends this paradigm to on-policy distillation and related self-distillation variants that supplement selfgenerated sequences with privileged information, textual or verbal feedback, additional context, or interaction signals (Agarwal et al., 2024; Zhao et al., 2026; Hübotter et al., 2026; Song et al., 2026; Xiong et al., 2026; Penaloza et al., 2026; Ye et al., 2026; Shenfeld et al., 2026; Buening et al., 2026; Stein et al., 2026). In contrast, SSD uses only temperature-shifted samples from the base model and standard cross-entropy training, without privileged context, feedback-conditioned teachers, or auxiliary supervision. 

**Code generation and synthetic data.** In code generation, synthetic-data pipelines often rely on large-scale sampling followed by filtering, clustering, verification, or execution feedback (Li et al., 2022; Le et al., 2022; Liu et al., 2025). Related self-training approaches such as STaR and ReST<sup>_EM_</sup> likewise convert self-generated outputs into supervision through correctness-based filtering or external feedback (Zelikman et al., 2022; Singh et al., 2024). SSD differs in that it trains directly on raw, unverified model outputs. 

**Reasoning and RL for math and coding.** Recent progress on reasoning and code generation has come from chainof-thought prompting, zero-shot reasoning prompts, self-consistent sampling, self-bootstrapping, and RL-based post-training for math and code (Wei et al., 2022; Kojima et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2023a; Zelikman et al., 2022; Shao et al., 2024; DeepSeek-AI, 2025; OpenAI, 2025). A complementary line of work studies reasoning improvement at the token level, identifying critical, high-entropy, or forking tokens as disproportionately important decision points in reasoning and RL trajectories (Bigelow et al., 2025; Lin et al., 2024; Vassoyan et al., 2025; Wang et al., 2025b; Cheng et al., 2025; Wang et al., 2025a; Gandhi et al., 2025; Li et al., 2025; Chu et al., 2025). Our focus is different: rather than asking which tokens an RL algorithm should emphasize, we ask how far plain cross-entropy training on a model’s own raw outputs can go without rewards or verifiers, and why it reshapes the distribution in a way that decode-only tuning cannot match. 

**Decoding and truncation.** At inference time, top- _k_ sampling, nucleus sampling, and truncation-as-desmoothing analyze how temperature and support restriction shape generation quality (Fan et al., 2018; Holtzman et al., 2020; Hewitt et al., 2022). Our contribution is not a new decoding rule. Instead, we show that training on samples generated under shifted decoding can alter the model itself, making a simple fixed decoding policy substantially more effective at test time. 

**Self-improvement without external reward.** Several methods improve language models using self-generated signal without human labels, but they still rely on internal critique, judging, filtering, or iterative self-evaluation (Wang et al., 2023b; Bai et al., 2022; Huang et al., 2023; Yuan et al., 2024). A closely related line,often framed as unsupervised RLVR or intrinsic-signal learning, replaces ground-truth rewards with internal signals such as majority vote, entropy, confidence, or self-certainty (He et al., 2026; Zuo et al., 2025; Agarwal et al., 2025; Prabhudesai et al., 2025; Zhao et al., 2025; Zhang et al., 2025); related analyses also study entropy reduction as a driver of reasoning gains and entropy collapse as a limit on exploration during RL (Cui et al., 2025). SSD differs from this line in both method and 

11 

mechanism. It is not an RL procedure that directly optimizes a scalar entropy objective or uniformly drives policy entropy downward. Instead, training on temperature-shifted, truncated self-samples reshapes the token distribution in a context-dependent way: it suppresses diffuse tail mass while preserving,and at fork-like contexts even increasing, useful entropy within the retained head. As a result,the model can become lower-entropy overall while more explorable where it matters. In this sense, SSD is better understood as support compression plus within-support reshaping, rather than direct Shannon-entropy minimization (Rényi, 1961). 

## **6 Conclusion** 

We have shown that a model can improve code generation by training on its own raw outputs alone. Across six models, simple self-distillation consistently improves LiveCodeBench, with the largest gains on harder problems; for Qwen330B-Instruct,pass@1 rises from 42.4% to 55.3% on LiveCodeBench v6. Our evidence points to a simple explanation: code generation mixes precision-bound locks and exploration-bound forks, and SSD reshapes token distributions so decoding can explore useful branches without reopening distractor tails. More broadly, these results suggest that strong code models contain latent capability that can be unlocked without a verifier, a teacher, or reinforcement learning.

## **A Decoding Pipeline: From Notation to Implementation** 

All inference in this paper uses vLLM v0.11.0 (Kwon et al., 2023) (commit `b8b302c` ).<sup>3</sup> The decoding operator used in the main text (Section 2) maps directly to vLLM’s `Sampler` class and its associated helpers. In this appendix, we unpack it into explicit temperature, top- _k_ , and top- _p_ steps. This section documents the exact order of operations to make the decoding semantics fully reproducible. Other logit processors available in vLLM (repetition, frequency, and presence penalties; `min_p` ; logit bias) are not used in our experiments; see the `Sampler.forward` docstring in `v1/sample/sampler.py` for the complete ordering when those processors are active. Given raw logits _zv_ from the language-model head, the pipeline applies four steps in the order described below; Figure 8 shows the full pipeline with annotated source excerpts. 

**Step 1: Temperature scaling.** Temperature is applied first, before any truncation, by dividing every logit by _T_ in place (Figure 8,panel 1). After a subsequent softmax,this is equivalent to raising each probability to the power 1 _/T_ and renormalizing, i.e. the Temper _T_ operator defined in Equation (5). Temperatures below 10<sup>_−_5</sup> trigger greedy (argmax) decoding, bypassing all subsequent steps. 

**Step 2: Top-** _k_ **filtering.** Logits are sorted in ascending order (Figure 8, panel 2). The _k_ -th largest value is found via `gather` , and all logits strictly below it are set to _−∞_ . This operates on the already temperature-scaled logits, so the ranking reflects _zv/T_ rather than the raw logits. When `top_k = 0` or `top_k` _≥_ `|V|` , this step is skipped entirely. 

**Step 3: Top-** _p_ **(nucleus) filtering.** On the same sorted tensor, a softmax is computed over the top- _k_ survivors (Figure 8, panel 3). A cumulative sum ascending from the smallest probability identifies the lowest-mass tokens whose removal still leaves cumulative mass _≥_ top- _p_ . At least one token (the highest-probability one) is always retained. The result is then scattered back to the original vocabulary order. 

**Step 4: Sampling via the Gumbel-max trick.** Rather than calling `torch.multinomial` (which incurs synchronization between CPU and GPU), vLLM draws independent Exp(1) noise, divides the post-truncation probabilities by that noise, and takes the argmax (Figure 8, panel 4). This is mathematically equivalent to multinomial sampling from the surviving support.

**Correspondence to paper notation.** The four steps above implement exactly the retained-support definition used throughout the theory (Section B.1): 



The implementation confirms that the order is _temper → top-k → top-p → sample_ : temperature scaling is applied to logits first, top- _k_ filters on the tempered distribution, and top- _p_ operates within the top- _k_ retained set (renormalized via softmax over survivors before computing the cumulative threshold). 

## **B A Theoretical View of SSD: Full Analysis** 

This appendix formalizes the mechanism behind SSD in a minimal setting. We proceed in the same order as the mechanism story in the main text. We first define the local objects that SSD fits at a single decoding context. We then analyze the training objective induced by those objects and show why SSD has a nontrivial learning signal even though it trains on the model’s own outputs. Next, we explain why the same global objective suppresses diffuse lock tails while preserving useful exploration at fork-like contexts. We then show why the resulting student can become lower-entropy overall while still preserving the conditional head entropy needed for exploration. Finally, we explain why decode-only tuning on the frozen model cannot reproduce the same effect. 

### **B.1 Notation and Setup** 

We analyze SSD at the level of a single decoding context. At such a context,the frozen model’s training-time decoding policy first selects a retained support and then induces a target distribution on that support; ordinary cross-entropy is then used to fit that target. We therefore begin by defining these objects in the order they are used. 

Throughout this appendix, we use the word _teacher_ only as shorthand for the frozen pre-SSD model that generates the SSD training data. There is no separate or stronger external teacher model. The distinction is purely temporal: the teacher is the frozen model before SSD training, while the student is the model being optimized to fit the teacherinduced target. 

A _context_ is a pair _s_ = ( _x, y<t_ ) consisting of a prompt _x_ and the tokens generated so far. At each context _s_ , a model with parameters _θ_ defines a next-token distribution _pθ_ ( _· | s_ ) _∈_ ∆<sup>_V −_1</sup> over the vocabulary _V_ . We write _p_ 0( _· | s_ ) for the frozen pre-SSD model used to synthesize the training data, and _pθ_ ( _· | s_ ) for the student distribution learned by supervised fine-tuning. At initialization, the student is the original model, so _pθ_ = _p_ 0. 

Training-time decoding follows the same basic pipeline used in the main paper: first apply temperature, then truncate, then renormalize. For temperature _T >_ 0 and a nonempty set _S ⊆V_ , define the tempered distribution on _S_ by 



When _S_ = _V_ , we simply write Temper _T_ [ _p_ ]. Low temperature sharpens a distribution, while high temperature flattens it. 

Given a distribution _π_ on _V_ , TopK( _π, k_ ) returns the set of the _k_ tokens with largest probability under _π_ ,with ties broken by a fixed deterministic rule. For any nonempty set _K ⊆V_ with _π_ ( _K_ ) _>_ 0, write 



Given such a set _K_ and a top- _p_ threshold top- _p ∈_ (0 _,_ 1], TopP( _π|K,_ top- _p_ ) returns the smallest prefix of the ranking on _K_ , sorted by decreasing _π_ ( _· | K_ )-mass, whose cumulative mass under _π_ ( _· | K_ ) is at least top- _p_ . Throughout the paper, both training-time and evaluation-time decoding first apply temperature and then truncate and renormalize. 

Fix training-time decoding parameters ( _T_ train _, k_ train _,_ top- _p_ train). At context _s_ , let _Ss_ be the teacher’s retained support after applying training-time temperature, top- _k_ , and top- _p_ :

In words, _Ss_ is the teacher’s retained support at context _s_ : the set of tokens that survive training-time temperature scaling and truncation. 

The target fitted by SSD at context _s_ is the truncated and renormalized tempered teacher distribution 



By construction, _qs_ is supported on _Ss_ . Whenever _Ss_ = _V_ — for example, if _k_ train _< |V|_ or top- _p_ train _<_ 1 — it lies on a proper face of the full simplex because it assigns zero probability outside the retained support. 

At context _s_ , SSD still uses ordinary cross-entropy: 



The important difference from naive self-training is therefore not the form of the loss. It is the fact that temperature and truncation alter the target before optimization begins. The rest of the theory is an analysis of what this target shift does. 

### **B.2 Understanding the SSD Objective and Its Learning Signal** 

The first theoretical question is why SSD produces any learning signal at all. If one literally samples from a model and then trains the same model on those samples without changing the target, self-training is an on-policy fixed point. SSD avoids this fixed-point failure because temperature and truncation modify the teacher-induced target before the student sees it. We isolate these two sources of signal separately and then combine them. 

**Naive self-training is a fixed point.** Consider first the degenerate case where the teacher samples from its own base distribution with unit temperature and no truncation. Then the training target is just the model itself, so the expected score-function gradient at initialization vanishes: 



The gradient of the log-probability, averaged under the model’s own distribution, telescopes because probabilities sum to one. In practical terms, if one samples from the model’s own distribution at _T_ =1 and trains on those samples, the expected update direction is the zero vector. Naive self-training therefore produces no signal. Any useful signal in SSD must come from the way temperature and truncation modify the target before optimization begins. 

**Truncation introduces a support gate.** To isolate the effect of truncation, first factor the loss through the retained support. Define the student’s mass on the teacher’s retained support by 



and the corresponding conditional distribution by 



Since _qs_ is supported on _Ss_ , the per-context loss can be written exactly as 



This identity reveals that truncation splits the learning problem into two levels: a _gate-level_ objective that maximizes mass inside the retained support, and a _conditional-level_ objective that matches the teacher’s within-support distribution. The gate cares only about the in/out partition; the conditional term cares only about relative probabilities inside the retained support. When _Ss_ = _V_ , the gate term disappears and the factorization collapses to ordinary cross-entropy against the tempered teacher. 

16 

The same factorization also explains why tail suppression is persistent throughout training. When _Ss_ = _V_ , the target _qs_ lies on a proper face of the probability simplex ∆<sup>_V −_1</sup> , assigning exactly zero probability to every token outside _Ss_ . Viewing the student at this context as an unconstrained softmax over local logits _z ∈_ R<sup>_|V|_</sup> , we therefore have 



but this infimum is not attained at any finite logit vector; it is approached only as outside-support logits tend to _−∞_ . Geometrically,the truncated target places the optimum on a simplex face,and the gate term drives the student toward that face. Training therefore never fully satisfies the gate penalty, maintaining persistent pressure to suppress tail logits throughout optimization. 

**Temperature reshapes the full support.** To isolate the effect of temperature,now remove truncation and study the full-support target. If _Ss_ = _V_ , the teacher target is Temper _T_ [ _p_ 0( _· | s_ )], and the loss can be written as a Rényi-shaping term plus a KL anchor: 



where 



is the Rényi entropy of order _α_ = 1. The Rényi entropy _H_ 1 _/T_ at order _α_ = 1 _/T_ interpolates between familiar extremes: as _T →∞_ ( _α →_ 0), it approaches log _|_ supp( _π_ ) _|_ , the maximum entropy achievable on the support; as _T →_ 0 ( _α →∞_ ), it approaches _−_ log max _v π_ ( _v_ ), the min-entropy. Shannon entropy corresponds to the intermediate case _α_ = 1 ( _T_ = 1). For the typical SSD setting _T >_ 1, the order 1 _/T <_ 1 falls in the sub-Shannon regime, which is more sensitive to diffuse tails and less tolerant of concentrated peaks than Shannon entropy is. Throughout, occurrences of (1 _− T_ ) _H_ 1 _/T_ are understood via the equivalent free-energy form _−T_ log<sup>�</sup> _v_<sup>_π_(</sup><sup>_v_)1</sup><sup>_/T_, with continuous extension</sup> at _T_ = 1, where the term equals zero. 

The coefficient (1 _−T_ ) determines the direction of the resulting pressure. For _T >_ 1, (1 _−T_ ) _<_ 0, so minimizing the loss _maximizes H_ 1 _/T_ and therefore smooths the distribution. For _T <_ 1, the effect reverses and the loss sharpens the distribution. At _T_ = 1, the Rényi-shaping term vanishes identically and the fixed-point symmetry of Equation (9) returns. The KL term keeps the student aligned with the teacher’s tempered preferences. 

This two-term structure already shows why even the pathological no-truncation, high-temperature regime of Section 4.4 retains a nontrivial learning signal: the Rényi-shaping term is nonzero whenever _T_ = 1. But because the reshaping acts on the _full vocabulary_ , it lifts harmful tail tokens just as readily as it diversifies genuinely ambiguous contexts. Temperature alone creates exploration but does not know where that exploration should stop. Truncation supplies that boundary. 

**Full SSD combines both effects.** Applying the same temperature decomposition inside the retained support and then reinserting the gate term yields the central three-term decomposition: 



_Proof sketch._ Start from the gate-conditional factorization Equation (12). For the conditional cross-entropy term,write 

_−_ log _pθ_ ( _v | s, Ss_ ) = _−T_ log Temper<sup>_S_</sup> _T_<sup>_s_[</sup><sup>_pθ_(</sup><sup>_· | s, Ss_)](</sup><sup>_v_)</sup><sup>_−T_log</sup><sup>_Z_</sup> _θ,T_<sup>_Ss,_</sup> 

where Temper<sup>_S_</sup> _T_<sup>_s_[</sup><sup>_pθ_(</sup><sup>_· | s, Ss_)]isthestudent’sdistributionrestrictedto</sup><sup>_Ss_andthentempered,and</sup><sup>_Z_</sup> _θ,T_<sup>_Ss_= �</sup> _u∈Ss_<sup>_pθ_(</sup><sup>_u |_</sup> _s, Ss_ )<sup>1</sup><sup>_/T_</sup> is the corresponding within-support partition function. Taking the expectation under _qs_ separates the first piece into 



17 

yielding the KL anchor term and the constant _T · H_ ( _qs_ ). The partition-function term becomes the Rényi-shaping term via the free-energy identity 



which holds for any distribution _π_ on a set _S_ . 

This decomposition is the objective-level core of the mechanism story in the paper. The first term compresses support, the second reshapes the retained head, and the third keeps that reshaping aligned with the teacher’s relative preferences. The final term _T · H_ ( _qs_ ) is constant in _θ_ and does not contribute to optimization. 

**Immediate interpretation.** The three-term decomposition makes clear what SSD is and is not doing. It is not learning from correctness labels, reward signals, or verification outcomes. Instead, it is fitting a target that has already been altered by the frozen model’s own decoding rule. Truncation decides which part of the distribution is worth keeping; temperature decides how the retained mass is redistributed within that support; and the KL anchor prevents the student from drifting arbitrarily far from the frozen model’s induced target. 

**Population limit.** The same decomposition also clarifies what training is trying to approach at a fixed context. At the level of an unconstrained local softmax over logits,as the loss approaches its infimum,the student drives all of its mass onto the retained support and matches the truncated tempered teacher within that support. For truncated targets,this limit is reached only as outside-support logits tend to _−∞_ ; at any finite logit vector, some residual outside-support mass remains. The student therefore does not converge toward the raw teacher distribution _p_ 0( _· | s_ ); rather, it approaches the teacher _after_ training-time temperature and truncation have already reshaped that distribution. This is the first precise sense in which SSD can improve over the base model: the target is not the original distribution itself, but a structured transformation of it. 

**Logit-level gradient.** The same mechanism becomes especially transparent at the logit level. At context _s_ , the loss is CE( _qs, pθ_ ( _· | s_ )), so the standard softmax identity gives 



Fortokensinside _Ss_ ,thegradientsplitsintotwoadditivecomponents: asupport-transferterm _−_ (1 _−_ KeptMass _θ_ ) _pθ_ ( _v | s, Ss_ ) that pulls mass from outside into the retained support, and a within-support fitting term _pθ_ ( _v | s, Ss_ ) _− qs_ ( _v_ ) that reshapes the head toward the teacher target. For tokens outside _Ss_ , the target is zero, so the gradient reduces to + _pθ_ ( _v | s_ ): strictly positive, meaning gradient descent pushes those logits downward directly. Tail suppression is therefore not an indirect side effect of fitting the head; it is written into the update rule itself as an explicit downward force on every outside-support token. 

This gradient structure also clarifies the relationship between SSD and neighboring paradigms. Policy-gradient reinforcement learning breaks the self-training fixed point by weighting the score function with an external return. SSD breaks it by altering the target distribution itself, so optimization remains standard supervised learning with positive, normalized weights. Standard knowledge distillation, by contrast, matches a full-vocabulary teacher and therefore lacks the support-compression term entirely; without the gate term, there is no mechanism to drive aggressive tail suppression. 

**RelationtoShannonentropyminimization.** ThisobjectiveisalsodistinctfromdirectShannonentropyminimization. As the preceding temperature-only decomposition already shows, SSD induces a Rényi-shaping term of order 1 _/T_ rather than a Shannon entropy term, and the shaping order varies continuously with the training temperature. Operationally, SSD still remains ordinary supervised fine-tuning on teacher-induced targets with positive, normalized weights, rather than an objective that directly optimizes Shannon entropy using signed policy-gradient-like weights. 

18 

**Summary.** The objective-level picture is now complete. Naive self-training fails because it is a fixed point. Truncation creates a support gate that pushes probability mass onto the retained support. Non-unit temperature reshapes the target inside that support. Full SSD combines these two forces, and the resulting gradients make explicit why the student can learn to suppress tail mass even without any correctness labels. The next subsection explains why this same global objective suppresses diffuse lock tails while preserving useful exploration at fork-like contexts. 

### **B.3 How SSD Reshapes Locks and Forks** 

The same global SSD objective does not act the same way at every context because the local retained support is not the same everywhere. Lock-like contexts are those where useful mass is concentrated on one or a few top tokens; fork-like contexts are those where several plausible continuations survive. This difference in local support geometry is enough to explain both the training-time asymmetry and the evaluation-time asymmetry emphasized in the main text. 

**Truncation makes the objective context-adaptive.** Without truncation, the Rényi-shaping term in Equation (15) acts on the full vocabulary: for _T >_ 1 it smooths the distribution globally, lifting useful fork alternatives and harmful lock distractors alike. Truncation changes this by restricting the reshaping to the retained support _Ss_ . The set _Ss_ is selected by the teacher’s local distributional shape. A peaked distribution reaches the top- _p_ threshold in very few tokens, while a flatter distribution retains many. The same global training rule therefore produces different local behavior depending on the size and geometry of _Ss_ . 

**Atlocks, supportcompressiondominates.** When _Ss_ issmall(asingledominanttokenplusperhapsonerunner-up), the Rényi-shaping term (1 _−T_ ) _H_ 1 _/T_ ( _pθ_ ( _· | s, Ss_ )) has limited room to act, because _H_ 1 _/T_ ( _pθ_ ( _· | s, Ss_ )) _≤_ log _|Ss|_ and the head entropy of a near-singleton distribution is already close to zero. The learning signal at a lock therefore comes primarily from the support-compression term _−_ log KeptMass _θ_ ( _s_ ),which pushes probability onto the retained support and directly suppresses the distractor tail. At the logit level, every token outside _Ss_ receives a gradient of + _pθ_ ( _v | s_ ) by Equation (17), driving its logit downward in proportion to its current mass. Because the truncated target lies on a proper face of the simplex, this downward pressure never fully disappears at any finite logit vector. The net effect is that lock-like contexts lose diffuse tail mass and typically become easier to secure under evaluation-time decoding; in the extreme case _|Ss|_ = 1, this reduces to pure support compression. 

**At forks, within-support reshaping has room to act.** When _Ss_ is larger (several plausible continuations survive truncation), the support-compression term is still active, but the retained head already contains most of the useful mass. In this regime, the Rényi-shaping term has room to matter. For _T >_ 1, the coefficient (1 _−T_ ) _<_ 0 means that minimizing the loss maximizes _H_ 1 _/T_ ( _pθ_ ( _· | s, Ss_ )), smoothing the distribution among the surviving alternatives. Crucially, this smoothing is confined to the retained support and cannot reopen the discarded tail. The KL anchor keeps this reshaping aligned with the teacher’s within-support preferences, so the head is flattened only within the set of tokens that the frozen model has already judged worth keeping. This is the formal reason the same objective can preserve useful diversity at fork-like contexts while still cleaning up the tail elsewhere. 

**Temperature sensitivity within fixed support.** The preceding discussion explains the training-time asymmetry. We now ask how evaluation-time temperature interacts with these reshaped distributions. Let _τ_ = _T_ eval. For algebraic convenience, write _γ_ = 1 _/τ_ and study temperature inside a fixed retained support. 

The relevant local object is the teacher restricted to _Ss_ and retempered by the power _γ_ : 



Differentiating _πs,γ_ shows that every temperature-sensitivity question reduces to a covariance identity: 



We now apply this identity in several ways. 

19 

**Useful sets and direction of reshaping.** Let _A ⊆ Ss_ be a nonempty set of locally useful actions such that _πs,γ_ ( _A_ ) _>_ 0. At a lock, _A_ may be a single correct continuation; at a fork, it may be a set of viable branches. Applying Equation (19) with _f_ ( _v_ ) = **1** _{v ∈ A}_ gives the absolute sensitivity 



Dividing both sides by _πs,γ_ ( _A_ ) and expanding the covariance gives the proportional sensitivity 



The right-hand side compares the average log-probability of tokens in _A_ to the within-support average. When these two averages differ, tempering redistributes mass between _A_ and its complement. 

This criterion captures the canonical lock and fork regimes. At a lock, the correct token typically has log-probability above the within-support average, so increasing _γ_ (lowering temperature) concentrates mass further on that token. At a fork,viable but lower-ranked branches can lie below the within-support average,so decreasing _γ_ (raising temperature) redistributes mass toward them. Because the tail has already been removed by truncation, this redistribution acts within a cleaned-up head rather than reviving the discarded tail. 

**Entropy sensitivity.** The same covariance identity also controls how entropy responds to temperature inside a fixed retained support, and this is the result that we will use directly in the next subsection. Differentiating the entropy of _πs,γ_ gives 



Equivalently, since _γ_ = 1 _/T_ and _dγ/dT_ = _−_ 1 _/T_<sup>2</sup> _<_ 0, the chain rule gives _dH/dT_ = Var _/T_<sup>3</sup> _≥_ 0: entropy is nondecreasing in temperature. The variance term therefore summarizes local temperature sensitivity: it vanishes for singleton supports and is also small for nearly uniform heads, while it becomes large when several viable alternatives remain with non-identical probabilities. After SSD, lock-like contexts typically retain either a tiny support or an almost degenerate head, whereas fork-like contexts can retain a nontrivial, uneven multi-token head. Evaluation-time temperature is therefore typically more effective at forks and less effective at locks, which is the asymmetry needed to alleviate the precision-exploration conflict. 

**Evaluation-time behavior under a local ideal-fit approximation.** The preceding analysis characterizes how the objective behaves locally. To connect that picture to evaluation time, we now use a local ideal-fit approximation and then state the two main consequences that follow from it. 

At a teacher-visited context _s_ , suppose the student has fit the training target: 



This should be read as a local approximation rather than as a claim that every trained student exactly satisfies it at every context. We also write 



for the frozen model after evaluation-time temperature and before any new support restriction. Under this approximation, the formulas below cleanly separate the contributions of training-time temperature and training-time truncation. 

**Temperature composition inside fixed support.** Inside a fixed retained support,training-time and evaluation-time temperatures compose multiplicatively. 

**Lemma B.1** (Temperatures compose multiplicatively) **.** _For any distribution p over V and temperatures T_ 1 _, T_ 2 _>_ 0 _,_ 

_TemperT_ 2� _TemperT_ 1[ _p_ ]� = _TemperT_ 1 _·T_ 2[ _p_ ] _._ (24) 

20 

_The same holds when p is replaced by any restriction to a fixed support set S ⊆V._ 

_Proof._ Temper _T_ 2[Temper _T_ 1[ _p_ ]]( _v_ ) _∝_ � _p_ ( _v_ )<sup>1</sup><sup>_/T_1�1</sup><sup>_/T_2</sup> = _p_ ( _v_ )<sup>1</sup><sup>_/_(</sup><sup>_T_1</sup><sup>_T_2)</sup> , and renormalization constants cancel. 

**Proposition B.2** (Evaluation-time form under local ideal fit) **.** _Assume Equation_ (23) _at context s, and let τ_ = _Teval denote the evaluation-time temperature. Applying temperature to the student gives_ 



_Inside a fixed retained support, the student therefore behaves like the teacher evaluated at the product temperature Teff_ = _TtrainTeval. Under the local ideal-fit approximation, this is the cleanest local formal version of the effective-temperature picture in the experiments._ 

**Proposition B.3** (Local gain decomposition under local ideal fit) **.** _Under the same local approximation, the student’s evaluation-time gain separates into a support-compression factor and a within-support reshaping factor. Reuse the restricted retempered teacher distribution πs,γ from Equation_ (18) _. We also need one scalar quantity: the teacher’s evaluation-time mass that remains inside the training-time retained support,_ 



_Then for any event A ⊆ Ss with πs,_ 1 _/τ_ ( _A_ ) _>_ 0 _,_ 



_This identity separates two improvement channels. The factor_ 1 _/ms_ ( _τ_ ) _is a support-compression gain: mass that the teacher would have leaked outside the retained support is recovered. The ratio of the two within-support conditionals is a reshaping gain: the student redistributes probability among the retained tokens themselves. The decomposition is algebraically exact under the ideal-fit assumption and is useful because each factor has a clean limiting interpretation._ 

_Remark_ B.4 (Two limiting cases) _._ Two limiting cases isolate the roles of the two ingredients in SSD. If trainingtime truncation is absent so that _Ss_ = _V_ , then _ms_ ( _τ_ ) = 1 and 



In this regime, SSD reduces to pure temperature composition. If instead _T_ train = 1, then the reshaping ratio in Equation (27) becomes 1, and for any event _A ⊆ Ss_ , 



In this regime, SSD reduces to pure support compression inside the retained support. Without truncation there is no support-compression gain; without non-unit training temperature there is no within-support reshaping gain. 

**Summary.** The lock-fork asymmetry does not require different objectives or context-specific hyperparameters. It arises because the same global objective acts on different retained-support geometries. At locks, support compression dominates, removing diffuse tail mass and making the remaining head more robust to evaluation-time decoding. 

21 

At forks, within-support reshaping has room to preserve and redistribute useful alternatives. Under a local ideal-fit approximation, the same picture carries through to evaluation time: training-time and evaluation-time temperatures compose inside the retained support, and the student’s local gain separates into a support-compression channel and a within-support reshaping channel. The next subsection focuses on one especially important consequence of this picture: the student can become lower-entropy overall while preserving the conditional head entropy needed for exploration. 

### **B.4 Why SSD Can Lower Total Entropy While Preserving Conditional Head Entropy for Exploration** 

A central empirical pattern in the paper is that the SSD student can become more concentrated overall while remaining more exploitable by evaluation-time temperature. At first glance, these two statements can seem to pull in opposite directions: if the model is lower-entropy after training, why does it still preserve the kind of diversity that supports exploration�The key point is that these statements concern different objects. Total entropy measures uncertainty over the full vocabulary, whereas evaluation-time temperature acts on the conditional distribution inside the retained support. We now make that distinction explicit. 

**Exact entropy decomposition.** To separate these effects, write the student’s conditional distribution on the complement of _Ss_ as 



whenever 1 _−_ KeptMass _θ_ ( _s_ ) _>_ 0. Expanding the Shannon entropy of _pθ_ ( _· | s_ ) over the disjoint sets _Ss_ and _Ss_<sup>_c_gives</sup> _H_ � _pθ_ ( _· | s_ )� = _h_ 2�KeptMass _θ_ ( _s_ )� + KeptMass _θ_ ( _s_ ) _H_ <u>�</u> _pθ_ ( _· | s, Ss_ )� + <u>�1</u> _−_ KeptMass _θ_ ( _s_ )� _H_ <u>�</u> _uθ_ ( _· | s_ )� _,_ (30) � <u>�� � � �� �</u> � <u>�� �</u> gate entropy head entropy tail entropy 

where _h_ 2( _π_ ) = _−π_ log _π −_ (1 _− π_ ) log(1 _− π_ ) is the binary entropy function. 

This decomposition separates three distinct channels through which SSD can change total entropy. First, as the student moves more probability mass onto the retained support, the binary gate term changes. Second, as outsidesupport mass shrinks, the contribution of the tail shrinks with it. Third, the conditional entropy of the retained head can itself change, either decreasing at lock-like contexts or increasing at fork-like contexts depending on how much room the retained support leaves for within-head reshaping. 

**Why total entropy can still fall when** _T_ **train** _>_ 1 **.** With the three channels in hand, the apparent paradox becomes straightforward to resolve. The support-compression mechanism identified earlier reduces total entropy through two large-scale effects at once: it suppresses diffuse outside-support mass, and in the high-retained-mass regime relevant here it also lowers the binary gate term by pushing more probability mass onto the retained support. 

The within-support reshaping term can act differently. At lock-like contexts, the retained head is already close to singleton, so within-head entropy has little room to increase and may decrease further. At fork-like contexts, by contrast, _T_ train _>_ 1 can flatten the retained head and therefore increase its conditional entropy locally. But this local increase is bounded by the size of the retained support, whereas the gate and tail reductions operate on the entire complement of that support. Total entropy can therefore decrease even when the student preserves or even increases conditional head entropy at the subset of contexts where exploration remains useful. 

**Evaluation-time temperature acts on conditional head entropy.** The operational role of evaluation-time temperature is now easy to state. Temperature does not act on the full-vocabulary entropy decomposition directly; it acts on the conditional distribution inside whatever head remains after training and truncation. Applying the fixed-support entropy-response calculation to the retained-head distribution gives 



22 

If the retained head is effectively singleton, or nearly uniform, the variance term is near zero and temperature has little effect. If the retained head contains several comparable but non-identical tokens, the variance term is substantial and evaluation-time temperature changes the operational policy much more strongly. This derivative therefore gives the formal version of the main-text intuition: lower total entropy and stronger exploration are not contradictory because they concern different levels of the distribution. 

**Why the teacher can be nearly temperature-inert while the student need not be.** The variance criterion in Equation (31) also helps explain the empirical asymmetry between frozen model and student observed in Figure 6. At many contexts, the frozen model’s evaluation-time distribution is already dominated by a single token: the kept set under top- _k_ /top- _p_ is effectively singleton, and the log-probability variance within that singleton is therefore negligible. In such a context, changing _τ_ barely changes the operational policy because there is no meaningful within-head spread for temperature to act on. 

SSD changes this asymmetrically. At lock-like contexts, the retained head can stay tiny, so decoding remains nearly temperature-inert. At fork-like contexts, training can suppress outside-support mass while preserving a nontrivial multi-token head, so evaluation-time temperature remains an effective control knob. In this sense, SSD removes the wrong kind of uncertainty while preserving the right kind. 

**Connection back to the objective.** The entropy picture is not a separate mechanism; it is another view of the same three-term objective from Equation (15). The gate term _−_ log KeptMass _θ_ ( _s_ ) drives support acquisition and tail removal, typically lowering the gate term in the high-retained-mass regime and shrinking the tail contribution in Equation (30). The Rényi-shaping term acts only inside the retained head, and for the typical SSD regime _T >_ 1, it smooths that head rather than the full vocabulary. The KL anchor keeps this smoothing aligned with the teacher’s retained preferences. 

This is why the lock-fork distinction reappears naturally inside the entropy decomposition. At locks, the retained head is nearly singleton, so the visible effect is tail suppression. At forks, the retained head contains several plausible continuations, so the same objective can remove tail mass while preserving or increasing uncertainty inside the head itself. The student can therefore be globally sharper yet locally more explorable. 

**Summary.** The apparent contradiction between lower total entropy and preserved exploration is only a mismatch of levels. SSD can lower full-vocabulary entropy by moving probability mass onto the retained support and suppressing diffuse outside-support mass. At the same time, it can preserve or increase conditional head entropy at the contexts where several plausible continuations survive truncation. Evaluation-time temperature acts on that conditional head, not on the discarded tail. The next subsection uses this same perspective to explain why decode-only tuning on the frozen model cannot recover the effect of changing the model itself. 

### **B.5 Why Decode-Only Tuning Cannot Match SSD** 

The previous subsections characterize what SSD changes during training. We now ask whether a _single global_ decode-only policy on the frozen model could reproduce the same effect. In the special no-truncation ideal-fit case from Equation (28), the answer can be yes: temperature composition alone makes local matching possible. The relevant question for the truncated regime studied in the paper is different: can one global decode-only policy match the student across heterogeneous contexts�In general, no. Under the local ideal-fit approximation, the student at a fixed context still has the form of a power transform on a retained prefix; the limitation is that decode-only tuning must apply one global policy to the frozen model’s original cumulative geometry, whereas SSD changes that geometry itself. 

**Decoding operators.** Let _p_ (1)( _s_ ) _≥ p_ (2)( _s_ ) _≥· · · ≥ p_ ( _V_ )( _s_ ) be the frozen-model probabilities at context _s_ , sorted by decreasing probability. Write _α_ = 1 _/τ_ , where _τ_ = _T_ eval. A decode-only policy composes three operators in some fixed order _σ_ . 

_Temperature scaling:_ 



23 

_Top-k truncation:_ 



_Top-p truncation_ , with prefix length _m_ top- _p_ ( _p_ ) = min _{m_ :<sup>�</sup><sup>_m_</sup> _i_ =1<sup>_p_(</sup><sup>_i_)</sup><sup>_≥_top-</sup><sup>_p}_:</sup> 



These operators slightly extend the empirical sweep in the paper: the experiments focus on the standard vLLM ordering, while the analysis below asks what any fixed ordering of the same ingredients can and cannot do. 

**Normal form: all operator orderings collapse.** A natural objection is that the empirical sweep in the paper tests only one practical operator ordering, namely temperature _→_ top- _k →_ top- _p_ as implemented by vLLM. Perhaps a different ordering would close the gap. The following proposition shows that it cannot: all fixed orderings collapse to the same restricted normal form. 

**Proposition B.5** (Normal form of decode-only policies) **.** _For any fixed permutation σ of Tα, Kk, and Ptop-p, the final decode-only distribution can be written as_ 



_for some prefix length m_<sup>_σ_</sup> _s_<sup>_that depends on the order σ, the parameters_(</sup><sup>_α, k, top-p_)</sup><sup>_, and the context s._</sup> 

_Proof._ Each operator preserves rank-prefix structure. First, _Tα_ is monotone in _p_ ,so it preserves the ranking and keeps the full support. Second, _Kk_ keeps the top- _k_ prefix. Third, _P_ top- _p_ keeps the smallest prefix whose cumulative mass reaches the chosen top- _p_ threshold. 

Therefore, any sequence of these operators produces a distribution supported on some prefix of the frozen-model ranking. Once the support has been reduced to a prefix _{_ (1) _, . . . ,_ ( _m_ ) _}_ , applying temperature yields probabilities proportional to _p_<sup>_α_</sup> ( _i_ )<sup>on that same prefix. The only thing an ordering can change is where the prefix boundary lands,</sup> because top- _p_ is evaluated against different intermediate distributions depending on whether temperature has already been applied. It cannot change the fact that the final decoder acts as a single power transform on a prefix of the original ranking. 

This proposition already shows the basic limitation of decode-only tuning. Reordering can move the prefix boundary, but it cannot create a new kind of distributional transformation. It also clarifies why this does not contradict the local ideal-fit picture above: at a single context,the student can still lie in the same normal-form family,but training changes the underlying cumulative curves and ranking that one global decoder must serve across contexts. 

**Two structural invariants.** The normal form immediately implies two constraints that no reordering can break. 

**Corollary B.6** (Prefix rigidity) **.** _For any order σ,_ supp( _µ_<sup>_σ_</sup> _s_<sup>) =</sup><sup>_{_(1)</sup><sup>_, . . . ,_(</sup><sup>_mσ_</sup> _s_<sup>)</sup><sup>_}. To include rank-_(</sup><sup>_r_)</sup><sup>_token, the_</sup> _decoder must also include every higher-ranked token_ (1) _, . . . ,_ ( _r−_ 1) _._ 

**Corollary B.7** (Power rigidity) **.** _For any surviving pair i, j ≤ m_<sup>_σ_</sup> _s_<sup>_,_</sup> 



_All pairwise log-odds inside the kept support are scaled by the same global factor α_ = 1 _/Teval._ 

24 

These two rigidities are the structural reason the decode-only sweep curves in Figure 2 are so flat. Prefix rigidity means a lower-ranked useful branch cannot be admitted without also admitting every higher-ranked token above it, even if some of those higher-ranked tokens are distractors. Power rigidity means the decoder cannot flatten one part of the head while sharpening another, cannot widen the head-tail gap without simultaneously changing within-head ratios in the same global way, and cannot treat some head tokens as useful alternatives while suppressing others as noise. 

**The standard pipeline makes the coupling explicit.** The normal-form result already shows that decode-only tuning is limited, but the standard practical pipeline makes the conflict especially transparent. Fix a context _s_ . After temperature and top- _k_ , the surviving distribution is 



Top- _p_ then keeps the smallest prefix whose cumulative mass reaches the chosen threshold. Define the prefix mass by 



Applying the escort-covariance identity from Equation (19) to the top- _k_ restricted distribution gives 



So increasing temperature makes the top of the ranked list accumulate mass more slowly, forcing the decoder to retain more tokens to reach the same top- _p_ threshold. The resulting prefix length 



is therefore nondecreasing in _τ_ , _k_ , and top- _p_ . 

This gives a very concrete interpretation of the three practical decoding knobs. Increasing _τ_ makes the retained head _flatter_ , but it also makes the retained prefix _longer_ . Increasing _k_ or top- _p_ makes the retained prefix longer, but neither changes the internal geometry of the head in any context-dependent way. There is no decode-only knob that flattens a useful fork head while leaving the support boundary of lock-like contexts unchanged. The knob that helps forks is exactly the knob that destabilizes locks. 

Under the standard pipeline, a single decode-only policy can satisfy both lock and fork requirements simultaneously only if _r_ F _≤ k_ and 



By Equation (39), increasing _τ_ to help the fork simultaneously lowers the lock-side upper bound. The same knob that makes it easier to retain more fork alternatives therefore makes it harder to keep lock supports short. This is the precision-exploration conflict in its most operational form. 

Reordering the operators can shift where the prefix boundary lands, and when top- _p_ precedes top- _k_ the final support can be clipped again by _k_ . But no reordering escapes the two rigidities above: the final decoder still acts as a single global exponent on a prefix of the frozen ranking. Reordering can shift the compromise; it cannot create a context-dependent transformation of the frozen model’s cumulative geometry. 

**Why SSD has a degree of freedom decode-only tuning lacks.** SSD escapes this limitation because training changes the base distribution itself from _p_ 0( _· | s_ ) to _pθ_ ( _· | s_ ). Once the distribution changes, the cumulative curves seen by the decoder can change as well: 



This is the degree of freedom that no decode-only reordering possesses. In the truncated regime, SSD can remove diffuse tail mass at lock-like contexts while preserving a cleaner multi-token head at fork-like contexts. When those 

25 

cumulative-curve changes move in opposite directions at locks and forks,the feasible interval in Equation (40) widens. This is the sense in which SSD changes the problem that the decoder is solving: the decoder is no longer operating on the same cumulative geometry. 

Even beyond support boundaries, power rigidity from Equation (36) still constrains any reordered decoder to a single global exponent on all surviving log-odds. SSD, by contrast, changes the underlying logits directly: ranks can move, head-tail gaps can widen context-dependently, cumulative curves can change differently across contexts, and the student can become simultaneously more concentrated and more temperature-responsive. That is the structural change that persists in the empirical decode-only sweeps. 

**The “truncate first” objection.** The most natural counterargument is to choose the support first with top- _p_ and only then use temperature for exploration inside that fixed support. This partially decouples support from temperature, but it does not solve the real problem. The support is still chosen from the frozen model’s own cumulative curve. If that curve concentrates mass poorly at a lock, the mistake is frozen in before temperature acts. If it under-represents a useful fork branch, truncating first may exclude that branch entirely, and later temperature cannot bring it back. 

So support-first decoding shifts the compromise, but it does not create the main SSD effect: locks becoming easier to secure and fork heads becoming cleaner without reopening the tail. The missing ingredient is still the same one: changing the model’s distribution itself rather than only changing how that fixed distribution is decoded. 

**Summary.** The distinction between SSD and decode-only tuning is structural, not merely parametric. All fixed orderings of temperature, top- _k_ , and top- _p_ collapse to a power transform on a prefix of the frozen model’s ranking. This induces prefix rigidity and power rigidity, and under the standard pipeline it ties exploration and precision to the same global decoding knob. By changing the model distribution itself, SSD can alter the cumulative curves and ranking that the global decoder sees. That is why a decode-only gap can persist even after the best sweep on the frozen model. 

## **C Experimental Details and Additional Analyses** 

This section provides the experimental details and supplementary empirical analyses that support the results in Sections 3 and 4. We first give the full training and evaluation protocol, then expand the hyperparameter and transfer results from Section 3, and finally provide the additional empirical details behind the toy simulation and the hightemperature stress test from Section 4. 

### **C.1 Full Experimental Setup** 

This subsection fully specifies the setup summarized in Section 3. The key point is that the training data consists only of competitive-programming prompts and the model’s own sampled solutions; no verifier, execution filter, or external teacher is used at any stage. 

**Prompt source and synthetic data generation.** All SSD training data is synthesized from the seed subset of the rSTARcoder dataset (Liu et al., 2025), used only as a pool of unlabeled competitive-programming prompts. After exact string de-duplication on the whitespace-normalized problem statement, this yields _∼_ 10,168 unique problems. For each prompt, we sample exactly one solution from the frozen base model using vLLM (Kwon et al., 2023) (v0.11.0, tensor-parallel across 8 GPUs) with a 128K maximum sequence length. The per-model decoding configuration used for this sampling step is listed in Table 3. We apply only a minimal degeneracy filter to remove clearly unusable outputs, such as empty responses and single-line stubs. No correctness verification of any kind is applied; the retained samples are the raw, unverified SSD training targets. 

**Prompt formatting and optimization.** All models are queried in a single-turn chat format using their official chat templates. For instruct models, each problem is wrapped in a system message requesting a Python solution inside a markdown code block, followed by the problem statement as the user turn. For thinking models, we keep the same task presentation but do not add an explicit chain-of-thought instruction; instead, we rely on the model’s native template to trigger its built-in reasoning behavior. Fine-tuning uses Megatron-LM<sup>4</sup> on 8 _×_ B200 GPUs, with expert

parallelism EP=8 for the MoE models. We optimize with AdamW ( _β_ 1=0 _._ 9, _β_ 2=0 _._ 95, weight decay 0 _._ 1) and cosine learning-rate decay from 5 _×_ 10<sup>_−_6</sup> to 1 _×_ 10<sup>_−_6</sup> , using global batch size 32 and sequence length 65,536. Instruct models are trained for 2,500 iterations and thinking models for 300 iterations; checkpoints are saved every 250 and 50 iterations respectively. 

**Evaluation and decoding settings.** Our primary benchmark is LiveCodeBench v6 (LCB v6; 131 problems, February to May 2025), stratified by easy, medium, and hard difficulty. We also report LiveCodeBench v5 (374 problems, August 2024 to February 2025) as a secondary confirmation on a larger set. The primary metric throughout the paper is pass@1, and we additionally report pass@5 and per-difficulty breakdowns. All pass@ _k_ estimates use 10 independent samples per problem. Frozen base-model baselines are evaluated with the model-specific baseline decoding settings in Table 4,while post-SSD models are evaluated with the student-side decoding settings in Table 3. Taken together, these details fully instantiate the compact setup described in Section 3. 

### **C.2 How SSD Hyperparameters Interact: Full Sweeps** 

This subsection expands the temperature-interaction results from Section 3.4. To keep the large ablation sweep tractable, these runs use fewer training steps than the main experiments. The main text shows representative views of the effect; here we give the fuller sweeps that make the same structure visible across both pass@1 and pass@5. 

**Qwen3-30B-Instruct full sweep.** Figure 9 expands the main-text scatter plots by showing the broader search over training-time and evaluation-time decoding configurations for Qwen3-30B-Instruct. 

**Reading the full sweep.** Two patterns matter. First, the successful configurations occupy a broad band rather than a single fragile optimum,which supports the claim that training-time and evaluation-time temperatures interact through a relatively stable operating region. Second, the truncated runs consistently achieve a higher pass@1 ceiling than the no-truncation runs, indicating that training-time support compression contributes something beyond temperature composition alone. 

**No-truncationresultsandeffectivetemperature.** Figure10 isolatestheno-truncationregime,wherethetemperaturecomposition picture is cleanest. In this setting,pass@1 and pass@5 are largely organized by the effective temperature _T_ eff = _T_ train _T_ eval: configurations with similar products achieve similar performance even when the two temperatures are factored differently. The broad peak near _T_ eff _≈_ 1 _._ 2 is consistent with the composition analysis developed in Sections B.3 and 3.4.

**Figure 10 Without training-time truncation, performance is largely organized by the effective temperature** _T_ **eff** = _T_ **train** _T_ **eval.** Qwen3-30B-Instruct without top- _k_ /top- _p_ truncation during SSD data generation. Panels show best pass@1 (left) and pass@5 (right) across the full grid of ( _T_ train _, T_ eval) settings. 

**Thinking-model confirmation.** Figure 11 shows that the same qualitative structure appears in Qwen3-4B-Thinking. The best-performing region again lies on a moderate diagonal band rather than at isolated values of either temperature alone. This matters because it shows that the temperature-composition pattern is not confined to instruct-style models. Taken together,the full sweeps support the two-part claim from Section 3.4: without training-time truncation, performance is largely organized by effective temperature, while truncation preserves that broad structure and lifts the achievable ceiling. 

### **C.3 Out-of-Domain Transfer** 

This subsection makes precise the main-text claim that SSD training on competitive-programming prompts does not substantially damage broader capabilities. We evaluate transfer on benchmarks for math reasoning, general code generation, and code understanding, and the resulting picture is scale-dependent rather than uniform. 

**Benchmark scope.** We use AIME to probe mathematical reasoning, HumanEval (Chen et al., 2021) to probe general code generation in Python and Shell,and CruxEval to probe code understanding,and MMLU (Hendrycks et al., 2021b) to probe general knowledge. These benchmarks are adjacent to competitive programming but not identical to it, which makes them a useful test of whether the student is merely over-specialized to the training domain. 

**The 30B models remain broadly stable.** The clearest pattern in Table 5 is that the two 30B models remain broadly stable under programming-only SSD training. For Qwen3-30B-Instruct, all changes remain within a narrow band of roughly _±_ 2 pp. Qwen3-30B-Thinking shows the same behavior, with only small benchmark-level shifts and no broad collapse in capability. Both 30B models also maintain their MMLU scores to within 0.3 pp. For the largest models in our study, programming-only SSD therefore appears to preserve non-competitive-programming performance reasonably well.

**Smaller models show more uneven tradeoffs.** At smaller scale, the picture becomes more mixed. Qwen3-4BInstruct shows clearer regressions on AIME ’24 and HumanEval Shell, even though it remains stable or slightly improved on HumanEval Python and CruxEval. Qwen3-4B-Thinking shows a different profile, with small declines on some benchmarks but substantial gains on CruxEval. Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct exhibits the sharpest tradeoff, losing ground on AIME while improving on HumanEval and CruxEval. By examining Llama’s generations on AIME, we found that the model frequently fails to output a final numerical answer and instead produces a code block, leading to near-zero accuracy. The transfer story is therefore best summarized as scale-dependent: the 30B models remain broadly stable, whereas the smaller models show more uneven benchmark-specific tradeoffs. 

### **C.4 Toy Simulation: Full Specification and Additional Analyses** 

This subsection provides the full specification of the toy environment introduced in Section 4.2. The aim is to make each part of the main-text mechanism story explicit: the FSM structure, the student induced by SSD, the global temperature sweep, the robustness to truncation choice, and the fork-level operational policy at the optimum. 

**Why this toy is informative.** The controlled simulation is designed so that every successful trajectory must traverse both kinds of contexts that matter for the paper’s hypothesis: a fork, where several continuations remain plausible, 

29 

**Table 6 State archetypes in the toy FSM.** The three state types instantiate a fail-dominated root, a broad fork-like head, and a sharply peaked lock with a diffuse distractor tail. In each row, the listed values are the highest-probability tokens; the remaining 12 tokens follow a geometric tail that sums to the residual mass. 

|**State type**|**Head probabilities**|**Character**|

**Figure 12 The toy FSM makes the lock/fork conflict explicit. (a)** The root branches into two symmetric successful paths, each of which traverses one fork and three locks before PASS. At non-root states, tok0 is the correct continuation and all other tokens lead to FAIL; at the root, the highest-probability token is incorrect. **(b)** The associated token-distribution archetypes instantiate a broad fork-like head and a sharp lock-like head with a distractor tail. 

and a sequence of locks, where only one continuation is correct but distractor mass remains in the tail. Because every transition is specified explicitly, success probability can be computed exactly under any decoding temperature and truncation setting. 

**FSM specification and state archetypes.** The toy uses a finite-state machine with vocabulary _V_ =16. The root branches into two symmetric successful paths, each of which traverses one fork state followed by _L_ =3 lock states before reaching PASS. At non-root states, tok0 is the unique correct continuation and all other tokens lead to FAIL. At the root, tok0 and tok1 enter the two successful paths, but tok2 is the highest-probability token and immediately fails. The three distribution archetypes are chosen to realize three distinct regimes: a fail-dominated root, a broad fork-like head, and a sharply peaked lock with a diffuse distractor tail. Figure 12 and Table 6 make this structure concrete. 

**The induced student is already asymmetric.** Applying SSD in the toy with _T_ train=0 _._ 9 and top- _p_ =0 _._ 85 produces a student whose retained support differs sharply across contexts. Locks collapse to a 2-token support: the correct token absorbs 94.8% of mass with only a single runner-up at 5.2%, while the remaining 14 tokens are pruned entirely (Figure 13a). Forks retain a broader 5-token support headed by tok1 at 34.4%, with the correct token (tok0) at 16.9% and three near-tied alternatives around 16%; the other 11 tokens are removed. At the root, 4 tokens survive with the fail token still dominant at 40.6%. This is the first key point of the toy: a single global training rule induces context-dependent reshaping automatically. 

**The global optimum shifts upward after SSD.** We evaluate the toy by sweeping a single global decoding temperature while fixing top- _p_ =0 _._ 80. Because the FSM is known exactly, the resulting success probability can be computed in closed form: 

_P_ = � _q_ root(A) + _q_ root(B)� _· q_ fork(correct) _· q_ lock(correct)<sup>3</sup> _,_ 

where each _q_ denotes the operational (post-truncation,post-temperature) probability of the correct continuation at the corresponding state. The teacher’s best global success probability is 8.32% at _T_ =0 _._ 639; the student reaches 13.77% at _T_ =2 _._ 091, a gain of +5.4 pp with the optimal temperature shifting roughly 3 _×_ upward. At their respective optima, both models retain a four-token fork nucleus, but the teacher’s is steeply descending ([48 _._ 2 _,_ 17 _._ 8 _,_ 17 _._ 0 _,_ 17 _._ 0]%)

**Figure 13 SSD reshapes lock distributions and flattens fork policies. (a)** Lock training reshaping: hatched bars show the teacher base distribution _p_ 0,solid bars show the student _pθ_ after SSD.The correct token absorbs nearly all mass (94.8%). **(b)** Fork operational policy at each model’s optimal _T_ with top- _p_ =0 _._ 80: the teacher has a descending four-token nucleus,while the student yields a flatter plateau that allocates more mass to the correct lower-ranked continuation. 

while the student’s is a near-uniform plateau ([32 _._ 1 _,_ 22 _._ 9 _,_ 22 _._ 5 _,_ 22 _._ 5]%), allocating substantially more mass to the correct lower-ranked continuation. This is the toy analogue of the mechanism claim in the main text: after SSD, lock states become more resistant to evaluation-time temperature, so decoding can spend more of its budget on useful exploration at the fork. Figure 14 shows this shift directly across three temperature regimes. 

**The advantage is robust and visible at the fork.** The student advantage is not an artifact of one carefully chosen truncation threshold. Repeating the grid search across top- _p ∈{_ 0 _._ 65 _,_ 0 _._ 70 _,_ 0 _._ 75 _,_ 0 _._ 80 _,_ 0 _._ 85 _,_ 0 _._ 90 _}_ leaves the student ahead throughout, with gaps ranging from +1.4 pp (top- _p_ =0 _._ 90) to +5.4 pp (top- _p_ =0 _._ 80). The same asymmetry also appears directly in the fork operational policy (Figure 13b): at each model’s own optimum, the teacher has a descending four-token nucleus, while the student’s is much closer to a plateau and assigns more mass to the correct lower-ranked continuation. Taken together, these analyses support all three qualitative pieces of the main-text story: safer locks, more usable fork-level diversity, and a higher globally optimal decoding regime after training. 

### **C.5 High-Temperature Case Study: Full Details and Additional Analyses** 

Section 4.4 presents a stress test in which SSD training uses _T_ train=2 _._ 0 with no top- _k_ or top- _p_ truncation. The purpose of the case study is to ask whether SSD still helps when the sampled training outputs are overwhelmingly poor as programs. 

**Why this case matters.** This setting directly tests a plausible alternative explanation for the paper’s gains, namely that SSD works mainly because it trains on sampled programs that are already fairly good. By pushing the training distribution into a regime where that explanation should fail, the case study isolates the contribution of distributional reshaping from the contribution of superficial sample quality. 

**The training corpus is deliberately poor.** We generate one sample per prompt from Qwen3-30B-Instruct at _T_ train=2 _._ 0 with both top- _k_ and top- _p_ disabled, using the same prompt pool as in the main experiments. All outputs are retained without filtering. The resulting corpus is visibly poor: across the generation shards, only about _∼_ 37% of outputs contain a chain-of-thought followed by an extractable code block, while about _∼_ 62% contain no extractable code at all. Even seemingly coherent outputs often devolve into multilingual gibberish mid-sequence. By ordinary data-quality standards, this is far worse than the truncated setting used in the main experiments. Training otherwise uses the same infrastructure as the main Qwen3-30B-Instruct experiments, and the final training loss rises to 11.29, reflecting the much noisier targets. 

**The student still improves across a broad region.** Despite the poor training corpus, the resulting student improves

**Figure 14 After SSD, the toy’s globally optimal decoding regime shifts upward because locks become more temperatureinert while forks remain exploitable.** The figure presents a complete view of the V19 toy simulation across three temperature regimes (columns: Low, Medium, High), organized as butterfly charts where teacher bars extend upward from the midline and student bars extend downward, with tokens ranked by descending teacher probability. **Fork row:** At low temperature, the teacher’s four-token head is peaked and the student’s nucleus is narrower but similarly shaped. At medium temperature, both distributions broaden, and the student retains more mass on the correct lower-ranked continuation (rank 2). At high temperature, the student’s plateau policy allocates mass nearly uniformly across the retained head,while the teacher’s tail remains diffuse. **Lock row:** The lock distribution is sharply peaked at the correct token (rank 1) under both teacher and student across all three temperatures. Trainingtime support compression collapses the student’s lock to a 2-token support (94.8% on correct),making it nearly temperature-inert. **Readout:** For each temperature column, the readout shows per-state sparkline summaries and satisfaction indicators for both teacher and student, alongside the end-to-end success probability _P_ = [ _q_ root(A) + _q_ root(B)] _· q_ fork(correct) _· q_ lock(correct)<sup>3</sup> . The student’s advantage grows with temperature: from comparable at low _T_ (5.5% vs 6.4%) to substantially better at high _T_ (13.8% vs 0.3%). **Curve:** The bottom panel plots exact success probability as a function of the global decoding temperature. The teacher (dashed) peaks at _T_<sup>_∗_</sup> =0 _._ 63 and declines sharply, while the student (solid) peaks at _T_<sup>_∗_</sup> =2 _._ 09 and remains competitive across a wide band.

**Figure 15 Expanded view of the high-temperature stress test (** _T_ **train** =2 _._ 0 **, no truncation) on Qwen3-30B-Instruct. (a)** A representative training sample: the first 12 lines contain coherent Python, but the output degrades into multilingual gibberish by line 13; approximately 62% of synthesized outputs contain no extractable code at all. **(b)** Best pass@1 (blue) and pass@5 (rust) across all checkpoints for each evaluation temperature _T_ eval _∈_ [0 _._ 6 _,_ 1 _._ 5]; dashed lines mark the 42.4% and 53.5% base-model baselines. The peak at _T_ eval=0 _._ 9 reaches 48.1% pass@1 and 64.0% pass@5. **(c)** Per-difficulty breakdown at the best checkpoint (iteration 2250, _T_ eval=0 _._ 9): hatched bars show the base model, solid bars show +SSD. Gains concentrate on harder problems: easy +6.8/+5.1 pp, medium +2.2/+9.9 pp, hard +7.3/+13.8 pp (pass@1/pass@5). 

materially. We evaluate every saved checkpoint from iterations 250 through 2,500 across ten values of _T_ eval _∈_ [0 _._ 6 _,_ 1 _._ 5], always using evaluation-time top- _k_ =20 and top- _p_ =0 _._ 95. This yields 100 checkpoint and temperature configurations in total, each evaluated with 10 repetitions. Of these, 62 exceed the 42.4% frozen-base pass@1 baseline. The best configuration reaches 48.1% pass@1 and 64.0% pass@5, and the gains again concentrate on the hard subset. The key qualitative point is that the optimum is not a single isolated lucky cell: it lies inside a contiguous late-training ridge at low-to-moderate _T_ eval. 

**The viable region is bounded, and that matters.** The same grid also shows that the successful region is sharply bounded. Performance remains competitive for _T_ eval roughly in the range [0 _._ 6 _,_ 1 _._ 1], but degrades quickly once evaluation-time temperature becomes too high, falling below baseline at _T_ eval=1 _._ 3 and dropping further at _T_ eval=1 _._ 5. This pattern is consistent with the temperature-composition picture developed earlier in the paper. In this regime, training approximates a high-temperature reshaping of the teacher without training-time support compression, so evaluation succeeds only while the resulting effective temperature remains inside a viable band. 

**Comparison with the standard truncated recipe.** The stress test remains visibly weaker than the standard truncated SSD recipe, and that gap is itself informative. When truncation is present during training, support compression is active throughout optimization and directly suppresses distractor tails in the student. In the present case, those tails are not suppressed during training and must instead be cleaned up at evaluation time by top- _k_ /top- _p_ truncation. The gains therefore remain real but smaller and more fragile. Taken together, this case study supports a narrower but important conclusion: even when the sampled programs are mostly poor, SSD can still help because the useful signal lies in distributional reshaping rather than in raw program correctness alone.
